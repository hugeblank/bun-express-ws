# express-ws
Quickly implement websocket API in express.

There are some issues with [HenningM/express-ws](https://github.com/HenningM/express-ws), the author has not been active for more than 1 year. So I created this project.

## Features
- [x] Use directly from app.ws
- [x] http and ws of the same route can exist at the same time
- [x] Support regexp routing
- [x] Support reading params, query parameters
